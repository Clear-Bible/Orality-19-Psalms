Verse	Polarity	Emotion	Intensity	Text	Context
Psalm 129:1	Positive	Resilience	Moderate	"Many a time they have persecuted me from my youth," let Israel now declareâ€”	This verse introduces a collective testimony of resilience in the face of persecution, where Israel is prompted to speak of past adversities.
Psalm 129:2	Positive	Resilience	High	"many a time they have persecuted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me."	This continues the theme of resilience, indicating that despite numerous persecutions, the speaker or nation has not been overcome.
Psalm 129:3	Negative	Suffering	Moderate	"Plowmen have plowed my back; they made their furrows long."	The metaphor of plowing the back suggests intense suffering and long-lasting oppression, like the long furrows made by plows in a field.
Psalm 129:4	Positive	Justification	High	"But the LORD is righteous; He has cut me free from the cords of the wicked."	Despite the affliction described previously, this verse shifts to express faith in the righteousness of the LORD and deliverance from the wicked.
Psalm 129:5	Negative	Defeat	High	"May all who hate Zion be turned back in shame."	This is an imprecatory wish against the enemies of Zion, hoping for their defeat and shame.
Psalm 129:6	Negative	Desolation	Moderate	"May they be like grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can grow,"	This simile evokes the image of grass that barely begins to grow on rooftops before it withers, symbolizing the futility and transience of the wicked.
Psalm 129:7	Negative	Disdain	Low	"with which the reaper cannot fill his hands, nor the binder of sheaves his arms."	The verse continues the metaphor of the previous one, emphasizing the worthlessness of the enemies' efforts, who are compared to grass that is not even substantial enough to be harvested.
Psalm 129:8	Negative	Rejection	None	"Nor do those who pass by say, 'The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.'"	This verse depicts a complete rejection of blessing those who harm Zion, suggesting that they will not even receive the common courtesies or blessings ordinarily given to harvesters.
