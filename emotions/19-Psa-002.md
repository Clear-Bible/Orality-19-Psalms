Certainly! Here's an analysis and emotional flow of Psalm 2 using a similar format to the given example:

# Outline of Emotional Flow for Psalm 2

1. **Rebellion of Nations and Kings**
    - **Defiance Against Divine Rule** (vv. 1-3): Nations and their rulers conspire and rebel against the Lord and his anointed king, attempting to break free from divine constraints.
    
2. **Divine Response and Assertion**
    - **God's Derision and Wrath** (vv. 4-6): A response of scorn and anger from the Lord towards the rebellious, establishing His anointed king despite their defiance.
    
3. **The Anointed King’s Rule**
    - **Power and Authority** (vv. 7-9): The decree and assurance given to the anointed king, granting him authority to subdue and rule over the rebellious nations.

    - **Warning and Counsel** (vv. 10-12): An advisory to the rebellious rulers to serve the Lord with fear and to seek refuge in the anointed king.

# Emotional Flow and Analysis in Light of Nussbaum's Views

1. **Defiance and Rebellion (vv. 1-3)**
    - **Anger and Enmity**: Nations and rulers express anger and contempt toward divine authority, challenging and rejecting the imposed boundaries. This reflects a lack of submission and a desire for autonomous control, also bringing forth a potent emotional conflict between human and divine entities.
    
2. **Divine Scorn and Assertion (vv. 4-6)**
    - **Derision and Wrath**: God’s reaction is one of mockery and righteous anger towards the rebellion, showcasing the emotional and moral dissonance between human arrogance and divine authority. It reflects God’s sovereign disdain towards any opposition and assertively re-establishes His determined plan.
    
3. **Authority and Assurance (vv. 7-9)**
    - **Confidence and Assurance**: The anointed king expresses a grounded confidence stemming from divine assurance. The strong, even possibly brutal imagery of shattering rebellion like pottery denotes a stark contrast in power dynamics and indicates a fear-inducing strength in divine backing.
    
4. **Warning and Wise Counsel (vv. 10-12)**
    - **Fear and Wisdom**: The latter part delivers a strong warning coupled with counsel to serve the Lord and pay homage to His anointed. This echoes themes of fearing divine power (evidenced by the previous violent imagery) while also potentially fostering an emotional turnaround – rejecting rebellion for a wise, life-preserving submission.

This emotional flow through Psalm 2 navigates through a gamut of human and divine emotions – defiance, anger, scorn, assurance, fear, and wisdom – interacting with moral and existential choices that come with either rebellion or submission to divine authority. Nussbaum's concepts highlight how these emotions are not merely ephemeral states but deeply entwined with the actors’ values, judgments, and existential standing in the narrated events, as they convey significant implications concerning power, morality, and destiny.
