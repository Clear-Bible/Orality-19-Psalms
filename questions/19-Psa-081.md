1. **Feeling the Psalm:**
   - How does reading about the "happy" person make you feel? Can you think of a story from your region that reminds you of this part of the Psalm?

2. **Picture This:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about a tree by the water. What kind of tree or place in your hometown makes you think of a joyful, healthy life?
   - The Psalm also mentions chaff blown away by the wind. What does this picture make you think of in real life?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The happy person loves God's teachings and thinks about them all the time. What's something you love to do so much that you think about it all the time?
   - How can you be like the tree in your own life? How can you avoid being like the chaff?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about people who do the right thing and people who do the wrong thing. What are examples in your life or community of these kinds of choices?
   - How does choosing the right thing help people in your family or community? Have you seen examples of this?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Are there certain plants or locations in your area that everyone knows represent strength or goodness? What about places or things that people think of as negative or weak?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do good or bad choices affect your friends and family? Can you share a story about that?
   - What positive things happen in your community when people make the right choices? What happens when they donâ€™t?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm ends with the idea that God watches over good people. How does it make you feel knowing God pays attention to your life?
   - In what ways do you try to live the right way so that God watches over you?

These questions are intended to encourage reflection on Psalm 81, drawing connections to personal experiences, cultural contexts, and the importance of making wise choices in life.
