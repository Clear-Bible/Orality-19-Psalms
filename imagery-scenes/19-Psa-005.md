### Outline and Imagery in Psalm 5

1. **Morning Prayer for Help** (vv. 1-3)
   - **Major Imagery**: Voice, morning, watch
   - The imagery of the “voice” in the “morning” sets a tone of immediacy and earnestness. The psalmist positions themselves as vigilant ("watch") and persistent in seeking God’s attention. This expresses an urgent dependency and a hopeful expectancy towards God, demonstrating deep emotional reliance.

2. **God’s Detest for Wickedness** (vv. 4-6)
   - **Major Imagery**: Evil, wickedness, lying, deceit, bloodthirsty
   - The stark imagery of “evil” and “wickedness” against God, who takes no pleasure in “lying” and destroys those speaking “deceit,” creates a vivid contrast between divine purity and human moral failings. This section pulsates with strong emotional evocations of disgust and moral outrage towards wrongdoing.

3. **Seeking Refuge in God’s Righteousness** (vv. 7-8)
   - **Major Imagery**: Abundance of steadfast love, worship, lead, make way straight
   - Amidst the strong rebukes, the psalmist turns to God’s “abundance of steadfast love” and seeks guidance to “make way straight.” The emotional tone shifts from condemnation of wickedness to a vulnerable and trusting supplication, highlighting a yearning for divine love and guidance.

4. **Condemnation of the Deceitful** (vv. 9-10)
   - **Major Imagery**: Throat, open grave, flatter, rebellion, cast out
   - This scene utilizes vivid imagery like the “throat” being an “open grave” and mouth that flatters to express the depth of deceit and moral decay. The plea for God to “cast them out” for their “rebellions” is intense and emotionally charged, reflecting a desire for justice and moral vindication.

5. **Joy and Refuge for the Righteous** (vv. 11-12)
   - **Major Imagery**: Refuge, glad, ever sing for joy, bless, shield
   - Concluding on a hopeful and triumphant note, the psalmist expresses the joy and protection (“shield”) found in God. The “refuge” for the righteous who will “ever sing for joy” transitions the emotional narrative from a plea and rebuke to a victorious affirmation of divine protection and favor.

In Psalm 5, a pathway from urgent prayer through stark moral contrasts and back to joyful hope and assurance in God’s protection is vividly portrayed. The psalmist travels through emotional landscapes of earnest plea, moral indignation, vulnerable supplication, and ultimately arrives at triumphant joy and assurance, guided by the richly metaphorical language and imagery. This psalm not only acts as a personal emotional and spiritual journey but also serves as a communal narrative that navigates through various human experiences and emotions in relation to divine interaction and moral disposition.
