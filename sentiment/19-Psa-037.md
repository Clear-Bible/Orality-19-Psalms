Please note that sentiment can be affected by cultural context and individual interpretation, and it's particularly important when providing resources for translation teams to reflect on the nuances of these emotions and polarities in the context of their own culture and language. The intensity levels are subjective; depending on the context of the cultural and literary framework of the target language, the translation team may assign different levels.
