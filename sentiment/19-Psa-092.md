To assist with your translation efforts, I will provide a sentiment analysis template for Psalm 92 using the New International Version (NIV) as the reference. Please replace `[Psalm Number]`, `[Verse Number]`, `[Verse Text]`, `[Polarity]`, `[Emotion]`, `[Intensity]`, and `[Contextual Notes]` with the corresponding information for each verse as you perform your translation.

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="92">
        <verse number="0">
            <text>A psalm. A song. For the Sabbath day.</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Uplifting</emotion>
            <intensity>Medium</intensity>
            <context>Introduction indicating that this is a song meant for the Sabbath, a day of rest and worship.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="1">
            <text>It is good to praise the LORD and make music to your name, O Most High,</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Joy</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>The psalmist expresses that praising God through song is a good and joyful act.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat the above template for each verse, adjusting polarity, emotion, intensity, and contextual notes accordingly. -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

This structure can be repeated for each verse in the psalm. Remember to carefully consider the emotional tone and context of each verse to accurately represent the text's sentiment. The examples provided are starting points and, depending on interpretation, can have nuanced differences in both emotion and intensity. 

Please note that sentiment analysis is somewhat subjective and the context you provide should be informed by an understanding of the culture and language you are translating into. The polarity (positive, negative, or neutral), emotion (joy, sadness, anger, etc.), and intensity (low, medium, high) will help to convey the tone and intent of the psalmist to your audience.
