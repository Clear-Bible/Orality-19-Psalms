Unfortunately, Psalm 59 does not have distinct scenes as it is a continuous psalm without clear breaks or shifts in theme. However, I can provide you with an overview of the salient imagery and the underlying positive force depicted throughout the psalm.

Psalm 59 appears to recount the distress and persecution experienced by the psalmist, possibly David, at the hands of his enemies. The imagery used throughout the psalm revolves around concepts of violence, destruction, and God's protection.

1. Verses 1-4: The psalmist describes their enemies as violent and bloodthirsty, metaphorically referring to them as "dogs" and "mighty warriors." The salient imagery here is the image of these enemies lurking and prowling in the evening, baying like dogs and seeking to attack. In this scene, the eudaimonic force lies in the psalmist's plea for God's deliverance from these malicious foes.

2. Verses 5-7: The psalmist emphasizes the evil intent and aggression of their enemies. The imagery here includes the portrayal of their enemies as vicious, snarling beasts, with mouths full of cursing and deceit. This image highlights the treacherous nature of the psalmist's adversaries and accentuates their intentions to harm and destroy. The eudaimonic force in this scene stems from the psalmist's trust in God's strength and reliance on divine protection.

3. Verses 8-10: God's role as a fortress and refuge is highlighted in this section. The psalmist uses imagery of a strong fortress and a shield to convey God's protective power. The salient image is that of God's unwavering presence as a shield surrounding the psalmist, guarding them from harm. The eudaimonic force in this scene emanates from the psalmist's assurance that God's steadfast love and protection will ultimately prevail.

4. Verses 11-13: The psalmist calls upon God to punish their enemies for their wickedness. Here, the imagery shifts to depict the enemies as arrogant and deceptive, with mouths full of cursing and lies. The salient image is that of the enemies being consumed by their own words, trapped in their own snares. The eudaimonic force in this scene arises from the psalmist's belief in divine justice and the hope that their enemies will ultimately face the consequences of their actions.

5. Verses 16-17: The psalmist concludes by expressing their devotion and trust in God's strength. The imagery here emphasizes God's power to defeat the enemies and the psalmist's commitment to singing of God's love and strength. The salient image is that of the psalmist's voice joining a choir of praise, declaring God's ability to triumphe over their adversaries. The eudaimonic force in this scene stems from the psalmist's faith in God's victory and the joy found in praising and trusting in divine protection.

While Psalm 59 does not contain explicitly divided scenes, these descriptions provide a glimpse into the imagery and the underlying positive force present throughout the psalm.
