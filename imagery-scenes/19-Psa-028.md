1: לְדָוִ֡ד אֵ֘לֶ֤יךָ יְהוָ֨ה ׀ אֶקְרָ֗א צוּרִי֮ אַֽל־ תֶּחֱרַ֪שׁ מִ֫מֶּ֥נִּי פֶּן־ תֶּֽחֱשֶׁ֥ה מִמֶּ֑נִּי וְ֝נִמְשַׁ֗לְתִּי עִם־ י֥וֹרְדֵי בֽוֹר׃
2: שְׁמַ֤ע ק֣וֹל תַּ֭חֲנוּנַי בְּשַׁוְּעִ֣י אֵלֶ֑יךָ בְּנָשְׂאִ֥י יָ֝דַ֗י אֶל־ דְּבִ֥יר קָדְשֶֽׁךָ׃
3: אַל־ תִּמְשְׁכֵ֣נִי עִם־ רְשָׁעִים֮ וְעִם־ פֹּ֪עֲלֵ֫י אָ֥וֶן דֹּבְרֵ֣י שָׁ֭לוֹם עִם־ רֵֽעֵיהֶ֑ם וְ֝רָעָ֗ה בִּלְבָבָֽם׃
4: תֶּן־ לָהֶ֣ם כְּפָעֳלָם֮ וּכְרֹ֪עַ מַֽעַלְלֵ֫יהֶ֥ם כְּמַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יְ֭דֵיהֶם תֵּ֣ן לָהֶ֑ם הָשֵׁ֖ב גְּמוּלָ֣ם לָהֶֽם׃
5: כִּ֤י לֹ֤א יָבִ֡ינוּ אֶל־ פְּעֻלֹּ֣ת יְ֭הוָה וְאֶל־ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדָ֑יו יֶ֝הֶרְסֵ֗ם וְלֹ֣א יִבְנֵֽם׃
6: בָּר֥וּךְ יְהוָ֑ה כִּי־ שָׁ֝מַע ק֣וֹל תַּחֲנוּנָֽי׃
7: יְהוָ֤ה ׀ עֻזִּ֥י וּמָגִנִּי֮ בּ֤וֹ בָטַ֥ח לִבִּ֗י וְֽנֶ֫עֱזָ֥רְתִּי וַיַּעֲלֹ֥ז לִבִּ֑י וּֽמִשִּׁירִ֥י אֲהוֹדֶֽנּוּ׃
8: יְהוָ֥ה עֹֽז־ לָ֑מוֹ וּמָ֘ע֤וֹז יְשׁוּע֖וֹת מְשִׁיח֣וֹ הֽוּא׃
9: הוֹשִׁ֤יעָה ׀ אֶת־ עַמֶּ֗ךָ וּבָרֵ֥ךְ אֶת־ נַחֲלָתֶ֑ךָ וּֽרְעֵ֥ם וְ֝נַשְּׂאֵ֗ם עַד־ הָעוֹלָֽם׃
