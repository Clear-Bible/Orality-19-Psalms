   - How does reading about the "blessed" person make you feel? Can you think of a story from your area that reminds you of this part of the Psalm?

2. **Picture This:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about a tree by the water. What kind of tree or place in your hometown makes you think of a happy, healthy life?
   - The Psalm also mentions chaff blown away by the wind. What does this picture make you think of in real life?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The happy person loves God's teachings and thinks about them all the time. What's something you love to do so much that you think about it all the time?
   - How can you be like the tree in your own life? How can you avoid being like the chaff?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about people who do what is right and people who do what is wrong. What are examples in your life or town of these kinds of choices?
   - How does choosing the right thing help people in your family or neighborhood? Have you seen examples of this?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Are there certain plants or spots in your area that everyone knows represent strength or goodness? What about places or things that people think of as bad or weak?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do good or bad choices affect your friends and family? Can you share a story about that?
   - What good things happen in your community when people make the right choices? What happens when they don’t?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm ends with the idea that God watches over good people. How does it make you feel knowing God pays attention to your life?
   - In what ways do you try to live the right way so that God watches over you?
