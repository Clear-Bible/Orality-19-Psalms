As you prepare to translate Psalm 74 into your own language, here is a template for sentiment analysis which you can use as a resource. Please replace the placeholders with the appropriate verse number, verse text, and analysis:

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="74">
        <verse number="1">
            <text>O God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Sorrow/Desolation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>The psalmist expresses a deep feeling of abandonment and questions God's seeming distance in the face of their affliction.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat the structure for each consecutive verse, analyzing sentiment, emotion, intensity, and providing context where necessary -->
        <verse number="2">
            <text>Remember the nation you purchased long ago, the people of your inheritance whom you redeemedâ€” Mount Zion, where you dwelt.</text>
            <polarity>Neutral</polarity>
            <emotion>Plea/Recollection</emotion>
            <intensity>Medium</intensity>
            <context>The verse reflects a plea for God to remember His actions of redemption and the special place of Mount Zion to Him.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="3">
            <text>Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Lamentation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Here, the psalmist is asking God to look at the desolation caused by the enemy, emphasizing the damage done to the sanctuary.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Continue analysis for the remainder of the verses in Psalm 74 -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

As you complete the sentiment analysis for each verse, consider the emotional tone, the intensity of that emotion, the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral), and any relevant context that would illuminate the meaning for your translation team and readers. Remember that cultural and linguistic differences may affect how emotions and sentiments are perceived, so it's important to adapt the analysis to be culturally appropriate for your specific audience.
