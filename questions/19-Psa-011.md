1. **Feeling the Psalm:**
   - How does reading about the "righteous" person make you feel? Can you think of a story from your culture that reminds you of this part of the Psalm, where someone is praised for doing what is right?

2. **Picture This:**
   - The Psalm compares the righteous person to a tree that is planted by streams of water. Can you think of a place in your community that represents nourishment and growth, like the streams of water? What does this place mean to you and how does it relate to a life well-lived?
   - The Psalm also mentions the wicked being like chaff blown away by the wind. What does this image remind you of in your own life or community? What happens when someone's actions are like chaff?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The righteous person delights in God's law and meditates on it day and night. Is there something in your culture or traditions that you find joy in and think about often? How does it shape your life and your decisions?
   - How can you strive to be like the tree described in the Psalm in your own life? How can you avoid being like the chaff? What actions or habits can help you achieve that?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - The Psalm talks about the contrasting paths of the righteous and the wicked. Can you think of examples from your own life or community where people have made choices that align with righteousness or wickedness? How did these choices impact their lives and the lives of those around them?
   - How does choosing the right path benefit your family or community? Have you witnessed any positive outcomes from someone's righteous choices?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Are there any plants or locations in your area that symbolize strength, goodness, or righteousness? What do these symbols mean to the people in your culture or community?
   - Similarly, are there any places, objects, or actions that are seen as negative or weak in your culture? How are they perceived and why?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do the choices individuals make affect the well-being of their friends and family in your culture? Can you share a story or example of how someone's choices impacted their loved ones?
   - What positive outcomes have you witnessed in your community when people make righteous choices? Conversely, what are the consequences when people make unrighteous choices?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm concludes with the idea that God watches over the righteous. How does it make you feel to know that God pays attention to your life and the choices you make? Does this bring comfort, encouragement, or accountability?
   - In what ways do you strive to live in a way that pleases God? How does this impact your daily life and decision-making?
