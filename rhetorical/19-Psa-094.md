- O God of vengeance, shine forth!

II. Description of God's intervention (Verses 2-7)
- Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve.
- How long will the wicked exult?
- They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast.
- They crush your people, O Lord, and afflict your heritage.
- They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless.
- They say, "The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive."

III. God's knowledge and intervention (Verses 8-11)
- Understand, O dullest of the people!
- He who planted the ear, does he not hear?
- He who formed the eye, does he not see?
- He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke?
- He who teaches man knowledge, the Lord, knows the thoughts of man,
- that they are but a breath.

IV. The blessedness of those corrected by God (Verses 12-15)
- Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O Lord,
- and whom you teach out of your law,
- to give him rest from days of trouble.
- For the Lord will not forsake his people;
- he will not abandon his heritage;
- for justice will return to the righteous,
- and all the upright in heart will follow it.

V. The wicked against the righteous (Verses 16-21)
- Who rises up for me against the wicked?
- Who stands up for me against evildoers?
- If the Lord had not been my help,
- my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence.
- When I thought, "My foot slips,"
- your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up.
- When the cares of my heart are many,
- your consolations cheer my soul.
- Can wicked rulers be allied with you,
- those who frame injustice by statute?
- They band together against the life of the righteous
- and condemn the innocent to death.

VI. The Lord's intervention (Verses 22-23)
- But the Lord has become my stronghold,
- and my God the rock of my refuge.
- He will bring back on them their iniquity
- and wipe them out for their wickedness;
- the Lord our God will wipe them out.
