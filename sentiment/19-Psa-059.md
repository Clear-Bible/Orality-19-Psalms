When conducting sentiment analysis for Bible translation, it's important to consider both the immediate emotions and the broader literary and theological contexts of the passage. Recognition of the type of literature (i.e., poetry, narrative, wisdom, prophecy, etc.) and the historical-cultural background is also important, as these factors can influence the translation and understanding of the text's sentiments.
