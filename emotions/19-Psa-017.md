### Detailed Analysis Considering Nussbaum’s Conceptualization

1. **Asserting Innocence and Seeking Fairness (vv. 1-5)**
   - Nussbaum’s exploration of justice-associated emotions is evident here. The psalmist seeks fairness, aligning with the moral fabric that demands rightful acknowledgment and action upon injustice.

2. **Experiencing Vulnerability and Reliance Amidst Threat (vv. 6-12)**
   - The psalmist’s emotional state embodies fear and vulnerability, prompting a dependence on a protective power. This ties into our emotional experiences when under threat, seeking safety and shelter.

3. **Assertiveness and Anticipatory Justice (vv. 13-14)**
   - Emotionally charged assertions and expectations of divine retaliation against the wicked indicate a strong belief in moral retribution and accountability.

4. **Hopeful Assurance and Eudaimonic Expectation (v. 15)**
   - The emotion of hope, along with an assured expectancy of justice and divine fellowship, links to the eudaimonic aspect, aligning well-being with virtue and moral fairness.

Psalm 17 navigates through a spectrum of emotions, intertwining with moral values and existential conditions, reflective of Nussbaum's understanding of the inseparability of emotions, morality, and flourishing. The emotional journey from asserting innocence, experiencing vulnerability, anticipating justice, to holding onto hope and assurance, creates a rich, morally and emotionally saturated narrative. This corresponds to our inherent emotional and moral dynamics, moving between distress, dependence, assertiveness, and anticipatory hope, all within the scope of our moral and existential frameworks.
