### Bridging to Nussbaum’s Perspective:

- **Joy and Gratitude (vv. 1-7)**: This emotional display, through Nussbaum’s eyes, could represent a harmonious state where positive acknowledgment of received blessings, both material and immaterial, directly relates to a flourishing life, a eudaimonic existence nurtured by recognitions and appreciations of such divine favors.

- **Confidence and Security (vv. 8-12)**: Nussbaum would perhaps identify this as an emotional manifestation where the security and confidence derived from divine protection contribute significantly to a stable, fear-mitigated existence, providing a robust emotional shield against threats and adversities.

- **Adoration and Hopeful Expectation (vv. 13)**: Within a Nussbaumian framework, this might suggest a recognition of, and reverence for, the higher, sustaining power, while the emotional hope extends forward, providing a constructive, future-oriented emotional and existential framework that encourages continuity and longevity in the relationship with the divine.

In essence, Psalm 21 engages with joy, gratitude, confidence, security, adoration, and hopeful expectation, intertwining these emotions into a rich fabric of expressive spirituality that honors past blessings, recognizes the present stability, and optimistically leans into the future with expectancy, all embedded within a divine-human relational dynamic.
