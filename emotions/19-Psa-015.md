### Outline of Psalm 15: Thematic and Emotional Structure

1. **Question of Worthiness**
   - **Inquiry into Righteous Living** (v. 1): Positing the vital question about who is worthy to dwell in God’s holy presence.
   
2. **Criteria for Divine Fellowship**
   - **Moral and Ethical Standards** (vv. 2-5): Enumerating characteristics and behaviors that mark someone worthy of divine communion.

### Emotional Analysis in the Lens of Nussbaum's Views

1. **Longing and Query (v. 1)**
   - A deep emotional and spiritual longing that impels the inquiry into the prerequisites of abiding in divine presence.

2. **Respect, Reverence, and Moral Approval (vv. 2-5)**
   - Emotionally charged respect and reverence for moral and ethical living, underpinned by a sense of approval and value for virtues.

### Detailed Analysis Considering Nussbaum’s Conceptualization

1. **Aspiration, Deficiency, and Spiritual Endeavor (v. 1)**
   - The inquiring stance reveals an emotional state of aspiration, perceiving a spiritual deficiency and subsequently striving toward spiritual and moral fulfillment.

2. **Virtue, Moral Satisfaction, and Emotional Integrity (vv. 2-5)**
   - A depiction of virtues and ethical living reflects emotional integrity and a deep-seated moral satisfaction in upholding righteousness and justice. 

In Psalm 15, the emotional undercurrent flows from a place of longing towards moral elevation, spiraling through respectful recognition of virtues, and moral-ethical behaviors, into a wholesome and integrated emotional and moral existence in divine fellowship. The seamless integration of emotional life with moral and spiritual aspects, as seen in this Psalm, resonates with Nussbaum’s articulation of emotions as deeply intertwined with our values, judgments, and thriving (eudaimonia).
