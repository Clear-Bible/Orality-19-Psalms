7: הָב֣וּ לַ֭יהוָה מִשְׁפְּח֣וֹת עַמִּ֑ים הָב֥וּ לַ֝יהוָ֗ה כָּב֥וֹד וָעֹֽז׃
8: הָב֣וּ לַ֭יהוָה כְּב֣וֹד שְׁמ֑וֹ שְׂאֽוּ־ מִ֝נְחָ֗ה וּבֹ֥אוּ לְחַצְרוֹתָֽיו׃
9: הִשְׁתַּחֲו֣וּ לַ֭יהוָה בְּהַדְרַת־ קֹ֑דֶשׁ חִ֥ילוּ מִ֝פָּנָ֗יו כָּל־ הָאָֽרֶץ׃
10: אִמְר֤וּ בַגּוֹיִ֨ם ׀ יְה֘וָ֤ה מָלָ֗ךְ אַף־ תִּכּ֣וֹן תֵּ֭בֵל בַּל־ תִּמּ֑וֹט יָדִ֥ין עַ֝מִּ֗ים בְּמֵישָׁרִֽים׃
11: יִשְׂמְח֣וּ הַ֭שָּׁמַיִם וְתָגֵ֣ל הָאָ֑רֶץ יִֽרְעַ֥ם הַ֝יָּ֗ם וּמְלֹאֽוֹ׃
12: יַעֲלֹ֣ז שָׂ֭דַי וְכָל־ אֲשֶׁר־ בּ֑וֹ אָ֥ז יְ֝רַנְּנ֗וּ כָּל־ עֲצֵי־ יָֽעַר׃
13: לִפְנֵ֤י יְהוָ֨ה ׀ כִּ֬י בָ֗א כִּ֥י בָא֮ לִשְׁפֹּ֪ט הָ֫אָ֥רֶץ יִשְׁפֹּֽט־ תֵּבֵ֥ל בְּצֶ֑דֶק וְ֝עַמִּ֗ים בֶּאֱמוּנָתֽוֹ׃
