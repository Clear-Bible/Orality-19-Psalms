2. **Picture This:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about a tree planted by streams of water. What kind of natural setting or landscape in your country represents a flourishing and content life?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The blessed person delights in God's law and meditates on it day and night. What is something in your daily routine that brings you joy and makes you feel connected to your spirituality?
   - How can you be like the tree in your own life, deeply rooted and thriving? How can you avoid being like the chaff, easily carried away by negative influences?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - Psalm 1 talks about the contrast between the righteous and the wicked. In your community or country, what are some examples of actions or behaviors that are considered righteous and morally upright, and what are some examples of actions or behaviors that are considered wicked?
   - How does choosing to do the right thing impact the people around you? Can you share any stories or experiences where someone's righteous choices made a positive difference in your community?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Are there any symbols or objects in your culture that represent strength, goodness, or righteousness? Alternatively, are there any symbols or objects that represent weakness, evil, or wickedness?
   - How are these symbols perceived in your society, and how do they impact people's behaviors and choices?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do good or bad choices affect your friends, family, and community? Can you share a story or example of how someone's decision had a significant impact on their immediate social circle or wider community?
   - What positive changes occur in your community when people make righteous choices? Conversely, what negative consequences arise when people make unrighteous choices?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm concludes with the idea that God watches over the righteous. How does it make you feel knowing that God is attentive to your life and actions?
   - In what ways do you strive to live righteously so that God watches over you and guides your path? Can you share any practices or actions that help you maintain a close relationship with God in your daily life?
