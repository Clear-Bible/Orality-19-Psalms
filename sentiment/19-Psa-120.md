As a translation consultant, keep in mind that your target audience may relate to the concept of distress and the need to call out to a higher power, the feeling of being wronged or lied to, and the desire for peace in a chaotic environment. Your task is to help the translation team capture these deep human experiences in their language, ensuring that the emotions and intents of the original text are preserved and understandable to the readers of the translation.
