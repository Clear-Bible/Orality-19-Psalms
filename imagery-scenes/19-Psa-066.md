11: הֲבֵאתָ֥נוּ בַמְּצוּדָ֑ה שַׂ֖מְתָּ מוּעָקָ֣ה בְמָתְנֵֽינוּ׃
12: הִרְכַּ֥בְתָּ אֱנ֗וֹשׁ לְרֹ֫אשֵׁ֥נוּ בָּֽאנוּ־ בָאֵ֥שׁ וּבַמַּ֑יִם וַ֝תּוֹצִיאֵ֗נוּ לָֽרְוָיָֽה׃
13: אָב֣וֹא בֵיתְךָ֣ בְעוֹל֑וֹת אֲשַׁלֵּ֖ם לְךָ֣ נְדָרָֽי׃
14: אֲשֶׁר־ פָּצ֥וּ שְׂפָתָ֑י וְדִבֶּר־ פִּ֝֗י בַּצַּר־ לִֽי׃
15: עֹ֘ל֤וֹת מֵחִ֣ים אַעֲלֶה־ לָּ֭ךְ עִם־ קְטֹ֣רֶת אֵילִ֑ים אֶ֥עֱשֶֽׂה בָקָ֖ר עִם־ עַתּוּדִ֣ים סֶֽלָה׃
16: לְכֽוּ־ שִׁמְע֣וּ וַ֭אֲסַפְּרָה כָּל־ יִרְאֵ֣י אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר עָשָׂ֣ה לְנַפְשִֽׁי׃
17: אֵלָ֥יו פִּֽי־ קָרָ֑אתִי וְ֝רוֹמַ֗ם תַּ֣חַת לְשׁוֹנִֽי׃
18: אָ֭וֶן אִם־ רָאִ֣יתִי בְלִבִּ֑י לֹ֖א יִשְׁמַ֣ע ׀ אֲדֹנָֽי׃
19: אָ֭כֵן שָׁמַ֣ע אֱלֹהִ֑ים הִ֝קְשִׁ֗יב בְּק֣וֹל תְּפִלָּתִֽי׃
20: בָּר֥וּךְ אֱלֹהִ֑ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־ הֵסִ֘יר תְּפִלָּתִ֥י וְ֝חַסְדּ֗וֹ מֵאִתִּֽי׃
