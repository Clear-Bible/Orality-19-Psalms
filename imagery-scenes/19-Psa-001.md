### Outline and Imagery in Psalm 1

1. **Path Choices and Character Contrast** (vv. 1-2)
   - **Major Imagery**: Path/way, law
   - In the opening verses, there's a distinct comparison between two paths — the way of the righteous and the way of the wicked. The "path" or "way" symbolizes life choices and moral directions, whereas the "law" stands as a metaphor for divine wisdom and moral guideline. 

2. **Outcomes and Prosperity** (v. 3)
   - **Major Imagery**: Tree, river, fruit
   - A vivid metaphor of a tree planted by the river producing fruit signifies the flourishing and prospering life of one who adheres to divine wisdom. The "tree" represents stability and vitality, the "river" indicates a consistent source of nourishment, and "fruit" symbolizes resultant blessings and prosperity.

3. **Contrast in Destiny** (vv. 4-5)
   - **Major Imagery**: Chaff, judgment
   - The contrasting imagery of the wicked as "chaff," which is light, directionless, and transient, denotes instability and eventual destruction. The impending "judgment" serves as an ominous foreshadowing of accountability and consequence, underscoring the inevitability of moral repercussions.

4. **Ultimate Divisions** (v. 6)
   - **Major Imagery**: Way/path, perishing
   - A reiteration of the path/way metaphor stresses the two distinct destinies based on one’s choices. The notion of the way of the righteous being known by the Lord emphasizes divine acknowledgment and favor, while "perishing" of the wicked conveys the finality and desolation of a path diverged from divine guidance.

Psalm 1 carefully constructs a narrative of two disparate paths, employing evocative imagery to underline the stark contrast between a life aligned with divine wisdom and one immersed in wickedness. The descriptive metaphors and consequent outcomes serve to illustrate the underlying principle of moral causality and divine justice, intertwining our choices, actions, and ensuing destinies with profound moral and emotional undertones. This navigates through choices, consequences, and ultimate destinies, linking our moral and ethical decisions directly to our spiritual and existential outcomes, thereby constructing a foundational premise for the Psalms that follow.
