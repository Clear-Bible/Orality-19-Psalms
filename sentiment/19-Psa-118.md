Sentiment analysis is a tool that can help translators understand the emotional content of a text, which is essential for conveying the original message in a new language. Below is a templated example for Psalm 118 using sentiment analysis:

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="118">
        <verse number="1">
            <text>Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever.</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Gratitude</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Opening verse expressing thanksgiving and affirming God’s enduring love.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat analysis for each verse as needed -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

Here are the first few verses analyzed for your reference:

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="118">
        <verse number="2">
            <text>Let Israel say: "His love endures forever."</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Reaffirmation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Invitation to the community of Israel to declare God’s enduring love.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="3">
            <text>Let the house of Aaron say: "His love endures forever."</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Reaffirmation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Calling the priestly line to affirm God’s eternal love.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="4">
            <text>Let those who fear the Lord say: "His love endures forever."</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Reaffirmation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Extending the call to all who revere the Lord to join in this declaration.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- The analysis would continue for the remaining verses -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

As a Bible translation consultant, my role is to help teams accurately and effectively translate the original text, taking into account factors such as sentiment and cultural context, which may influence understanding and interpretation. While this exercise doesn't cover the entire Psalm, teams should perform a similar analysis for each verse to ensure they capture the nuances of the text in their own language translations.
