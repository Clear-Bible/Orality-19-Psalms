2. **Derision (God Mocking the Rebellious)**:
   - *Explanation*: Derision is an emotion expressed through mocking or ridiculing someone. In this context, it's God's response to the futile rebellion of earthly rulers.
   - *Questions for Reflection*:
     1. How is mockery, especially concerning authority or powerful figures, viewed in your society? Are there forms of subtle derision, or is it usually direct?
     2. Are there idiomatic expressions or traditional tales in your culture that showcase powerful figures mocking subordinates or vice versa?

   - *Questions for Reflection*:
     1. How does your culture understand expressions of anger, particularly from figures of authority? Is it seen as justified righteousness or uncontrolled emotion?
     2. What symbols, events, or characters in your culture's stories represent righteous anger? How are these depictions received culturally?

4. **Fear (Being in Awe of Godâ€™s Power)**:
   - *Explanation*: This type of fear stems from recognizing the magnitude of God's power, leading to a wise, reverential submission.

     2. Are there rituals, practices, or narratives that depict the emotion of fear in a reverential context within your traditions?

### Imagery Translation and Cultural Context

Psalm 2 employs imagery like the "rod of iron" and the idea of "breaking" the rebellious, which are vivid portrayals of strength and authority. Consider these reflective questions for translating this imagery:

1. **Rod of Iron (Unyielding Strength and Authority)**:
   - What objects or materials in your environment symbolize strength and authority? Are there alternatives to "iron" that would better resonate with your culture's experiences?
   - How are authority and discipline portrayed in your traditional texts or oral histories? Are there artifacts or symbols commonly associated with these concepts?

2. **Breaking Pottery (Destruction of the Rebellious)**:
   - Are there crafts, objects, or natural phenomena in your cultural setting that represent fragility and can be shattered or broken easily?
   - What acts of breaking or shattering are symbolic in your community? Do they carry a connotation of judgment, destruction, or even rebirth?

By reflecting on these emotions and images, translators can delve deeper into their own cultural understanding of these concepts. This process is crucial to render the text in a way that maintains its original emotional intensity and pictorial beauty while making it relevant and comprehensible within the target culture.
