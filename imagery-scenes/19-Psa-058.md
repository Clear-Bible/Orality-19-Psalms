5: חֲמַת־ לָ֗מוֹ כִּדְמ֥וּת חֲמַת־ נָחָ֑שׁ כְּמוֹ־ פֶ֥תֶן חֵ֝רֵ֗שׁ יַאְטֵ֥ם אָזְנֽוֹ׃
6: אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־ יִ֭שְׁמַע לְק֣וֹל מְלַחֲשִׁ֑ים חוֹבֵ֖ר חֲבָרִ֣ים מְחֻכָּֽם׃
7: אֱֽלֹהִ֗ים הֲרָס־ שִׁנֵּ֥ימוֹ בְּפִ֑ימוֹ מַלְתְּע֥וֹת כְּ֝פִירִ֗ים נְתֹ֣ץ ׀ יְהוָֽה׃
8: יִמָּאֲס֣וּ כְמוֹ־ מַ֭יִם יִתְהַלְּכוּ־ לָ֑מוֹ יִדְרֹ֥ךְ כְּמ֣וֹ יִתְמֹלָֽלוּ׃
9: כְּמ֣וֹ שַׁ֭בְּלוּל תֶּ֣מֶס יַהֲלֹ֑ךְ נֵ֥פֶל אֵ֝֗שֶׁת בַּל־ חָ֥זוּ שָֽׁמֶשׁ׃
10: בְּטֶ֤רֶם יָבִ֣ינוּ סִּֽירֹתֵיכֶ֣ם אָטָ֑ד כְּמוֹ־ חַ֥י כְּמוֹ־ חָ֝ר֗וֹן יִשְׂעָרֶֽנּוּ׃
11: יִשְׂמַ֣ח צַ֭דִּיק כִּי־ חָזָ֣ה נָקָ֑ם פְּעָמָ֥יו יִ֝רְחַ֗ץ בְּדַ֣ם הָרָשָֽׁע׃
12: וְיֹאמַ֣ר אָ֭דָם אַךְ־ פְּרִ֣י לַצַּדִּ֑יק אַ֥ךְ יֵשׁ־ אֱ֝לֹהִ֗ים שֹׁפְטִ֥ים בָּאָֽרֶץ׃
