### Outline and Imagery in Psalm 2

1. **Rebellion Against Divine Authority** (vv. 1-3)
   - **Major Imagery**: Nations, kings, rulers, bands, cords
   - This scene introduces the defiant stance of nations and rulers against God and His anointed. The imagery of “bands” and “cords” reflects the perceived constraints of divine authority, revealing the rulers’ aversion to submission. The united front of “nations” and “kings” conveys widespread rebellion, indicating collective resistance to God’s sovereignty.

2. **Divine Response and Decree** (vv. 4-9)
   - **Major Imagery**: He who sits in the heavens, derision, vexation, iron rod, shattered pottery
   - The contrasting image of God’s reaction to human defiance underscores His absolute power. The metaphor of God “sitting” denotes a position of assured authority, while “derision” and “vexation” signify the inconsequentiality of the rebellion. The imagery of an “iron rod” and “shattered pottery” explicitly symbolizes God’s unassailable might and the fragility of the rebellious.

3. **Warning and Exhortation** (vv. 10-12)
   - **Major Imagery**: Be wise, serve, kiss the Son, perishing, refuge
   - The concluding part offers a sober warning and counsel to earthly rulers. It employs a nurturing yet firm tone, advocating for wisdom (“be wise”), obedience (“serve”), and allegiance (“kiss the Son”). “Perishing” communicates the grave outcome of neglecting this counsel, while “refuge” in the Son implies protection and salvation for those who yield.

The second Psalm navigates through the realms of rebellion, divine dominion, and the resulting outcomes of both defiance and allegiance. By juxtaposing the futile revolt of worldly powers with the steadfast and supreme authority of the divine, the Psalm elucidates the incongruity between human audacity and divine omnipotence. The consequent imagery and counsel unveil a poignant perspective on the ultimate futility of resisting the eternal and implore acknowledgment and reverence towards the sanctity of divine governance. This underlying theme reverberates through the Psalm, offering both a solemn warning and a beacon of refuge for those who heed its words, aligning closely with the contrast and moral framework introduced in Psalm 1.
