Scene 1: A Desolate Earth (Verses 1-3)
In this opening scene, the psalmist describes the abandoned and desolate state of the earth. The image of silence is portrayed as the psalmist says, "Praise is due to you, O God, in Zion; and to you shall vows be performed, O you who answer prayer!" (v. 1). The imagery of a "deserted land" and the "silence of the stormy sea" highlights the emptiness and lack of life. Despite the desolation, the eudaimonic force present in this scene is the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the expectation of praise.

Scene 2: A Bountiful Harvest (Verses 4-8)
In this scene, the psalmist shifts the focus to a scene of abundance and fertility in the world. The imagery of a fruitful harvest is portrayed through phrases such as "the meadows clothe themselves with flocks" and "the valleys deck themselves with grain" (v. 13). This scene showcases nature's ability to produce and sustain life, symbolizing God's provision and care. The eudaimonic force here lies in the gratitude and joy that arise from recognizing the plentiful blessings bestowed upon the earth.

Scene 3: The Power of God (Verses 9-13)
The third scene emphasizes the majesty and power of God. The imagery used includes "the stilling of the roaring seas" and "the tumult of peoples" (v. 7). These images illustrate God's ability to control chaotic elements and bring peace. The eudaimonic force in this scene emerges from the reassurance and awe evoked by acknowledging God's sovereignty and his ability to bring order to the world.

Scene 4: Abundance and Overflowing Blessings (Verses 14-15)
The final scene depicts a prosperous condition resulting from God's blessings. The psalmist paints a picture of abundance and overflow, using the image of fields covered with flocks and valleys clothed in grain (v. 13). This scene represents the fulfillment and satisfaction that arise from being under God's provision. The eudaimonic force lies in the contentment and joy experienced when one realizes the abundance bestowed upon them.
