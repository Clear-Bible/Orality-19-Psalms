2: אָמַ֣רְתְּ לַֽ֭יהוָה אֲדֹנָ֣י אָ֑תָּה ט֝וֹבָתִ֗י בַּל־ עָלֶֽיךָ׃
3: לִ֭קְדוֹשִׁים אֲשֶׁר־ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הֵ֑מָּה וְ֝אַדִּירֵ֗י כָּל־ חֶפְצִי־ בָֽם׃
4: יִרְבּ֥וּ עַצְּבוֹתָם֮ אַחֵ֪ר מָ֫הָ֥רוּ בַּל־ אַסִּ֣יךְ נִסְכֵּיהֶ֣ם מִדָּ֑ם וּֽבַל־ אֶשָּׂ֥א אֶת־ שְׁ֝מוֹתָ֗ם עַל־ שְׂפָתָֽי׃
5: יְֽהוָ֗ה מְנָת־ חֶלְקִ֥י וְכוֹסִ֑י אַ֝תָּ֗ה תּוֹמִ֥יךְ גּוֹרָלִֽי׃
6: חֲבָלִ֣ים נָֽפְלוּ־ לִ֭י בַּנְּעִמִ֑ים אַף־ נַ֝חֲלָ֗ת שָֽׁפְרָ֥ה עָלֽ͏ָי׃
7: אֲבָרֵ֗ךְ אֶת־ יְ֭הוָה אֲשֶׁ֣ר יְעָצָ֑נִי אַף־ לֵ֝יל֗וֹת יִסְּר֥וּנִי כִלְיוֹתָֽי׃
8: שִׁוִּ֬יתִי יְהוָ֣ה לְנֶגְדִּ֣י תָמִ֑יד כִּ֥י מִֽ֝ימִינִ֗י בַּל־ אֶמּֽוֹט׃
9: לָכֵ֤ן ׀ שָׂמַ֣ח לִ֭בִּי וַיָּ֣גֶל כְּבוֹדִ֑י אַף־ בְּ֝שָׂרִ֗י יִשְׁכֹּ֥ן לָבֶֽטַח׃
10: כִּ֤י ׀ לֹא־ תַעֲזֹ֣ב נַפְשִׁ֣י לִשְׁא֑וֹל לֹֽא־ תִתֵּ֥ן חֲ֝סִידְךָ֗ לִרְא֥וֹת שָֽׁחַת׃
11: תּֽוֹדִיעֵנִי֮ אֹ֤רַח חַ֫יִּ֥ים שֹׂ֣בַע שְׂ֭מָחוֹת אֶת־ פָּנֶ֑יךָ נְעִמ֖וֹת בִּימִינְךָ֣ נֶֽצַח׃
