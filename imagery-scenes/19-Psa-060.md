# Imagery Outline of Psalm 60

## Scene 1: Plea for Help in the Midst of Defeat

> "You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us! You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking." - Psalm 60:1-2 (NIV)

<!--- Possible source of confusion. Your translation says 60:1-2, but that's following the NIV numbering, not the Hebrew shown above. It threw me for a minute because the translation didn't match the text. Suspect this is true throughout all the psalms with headers that are omitted in English. Whether we need to fix it now or not is up to you. --->

- Scene:
  - The psalmist is expressing their distress and acknowledging that God has rejected and been angry with them.
  - The land is described as being shaken and torn open, possibly indicating the aftermath of a battle or a natural disaster.
  
  <!--- I don't know where it gets "aftermath of a battle." Those don't normally fracture the land, that's a modern thing. --->
  
- Imagery:
  - Rejection and anger from God
  - Shaken and fractured land

## Scene 2: God's Promised Land


> "You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger. But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow." - Psalm 60:3-4 (NIV)

- Scene:
  - The psalmist acknowledges that God has allowed difficult times for His people, causing them to stagger like they have been given intoxicating wine.
  - However, for those who fear God, He has raised a banner or a standard of protection against their enemies.
- Imagery:
  - Desperate times leading to staggering
  - Intoxicating wine
  - The raising of a banner

## Scene 3: Restoration and Victory

<!--- I'm not sure where chatGPT get "restoration" here? --->

> "Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered. God has spoken from his sanctuary: 'In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.'" - Psalm 60:5-6 (NIV)

- Scene:
  - The psalmist appeals to God for salvation and assistance, asking for His right hand, which symbolizes strength and power.
  - God is said to have spoken from his sanctuary, indicating a divine decree or promise.
  - The psalmist declares that God will triumph and distribute land, mentioning Shechem and the Valley of Sukkoth.
- Imagery:
  - God's right hand as a sign of strength and help
  - God's sanctuary as a place of divine communication
  - Triumph and distribution of land

## Scene 4: Ephraim and Judah as God's Instruments

> "Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter. Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph." - Psalm 60:7-8 (NIV)

- Scene:
  - God claims ownership of Gilead and Manasseh, as well as seeing Ephraim as His helmet and Judah as His scepter.
  - The neighboring nations of Moab, Edom, and Philistia are depicted as submissive under God's dominion.
  
  <!--- I would question "submissive" in this scene. Ownership/dominion, but not submission in the sense of vassals. --->
  
- Imagery:
  - Ownership of Gilead and Manasseh
  - Ephraim as a helmet
  - Judah as a scepter
  - Moab as a washbasin
  - Edom as a sandal
  - Triumph over Philistia

## Scene 5: God's Help in Battle

> "Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?" - Psalm 60:9-10 (NIV)

- Scene:
  - The psalmist questions who will lead them to victory over the fortified city of Edom.
  - They acknowledge that God has seemingly rejected them and does not go out with their armies as before.
- Imagery:
  - The need for guidance to the fortified city
  - God's apparent rejection and absence with the armies

## Scene 6: Dependence on God's Help

> "Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless. With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies." - Psalm 60:11-12 (NIV)

- Scene:
  - The psalmist appeals to God for assistance against the enemy, recognizing that human help is insufficient.
  - They express confidence in God's power to grant victory and crush their enemies.
- Imagery:
  - Assistance against the enemy
