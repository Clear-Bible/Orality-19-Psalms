Nussbaum would recognize how the psalm reflects complex emotional and moral themes—such as admiration for virtue (both divine-bestowed and inherent), the transformative power of new roles (seen with the queen), and the deep-seated human longing for continuity and a lasting legacy. These themes are not just personal but are interwoven with societal values and the human understanding of divinity, governance, and familial lineage.
