Below is a template you can use to help in your translation work. Since you did not specify particular verses or text for sentiment analysis, I have filled in placeholders. You can replace the placeholders with the specific text and analysis for each verse of Psalm 31.

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="31">
        <verse number="0">
            <text>For the director of music. A psalm of David.</text>
            <polarity>Neutral</polarity>
            <emotion>None</emotion>
            <intensity>Low</intensity>
            <context>This introductory note provides information regarding the Psalm's intended use and its authorship, which is ascribed to David.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Replace the [...] placeholders with actual verse numbers and text -->
        <verse number="[Verse Number]">
            <text>[Verse Text]</text>
            <polarity>[Polarity]</polarity>
            <emotion>[Emotion]</emotion>
            <intensity>[Intensity]</intensity>
            <context>[Contextual Notes]</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat for each verse up to Psalm 31:24 (NIV numbering) -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

Please provide the text of the verses you would like analyzed for sentiment, emotion, intensity, and contextual notes, and I can help you fill in the template accordingly.
