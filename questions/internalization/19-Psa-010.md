# Psalm 10

Psalm 10 is a passionate plea to God for justice and deliverance from the wicked. Here are some discussion questions organized by sections of the Psalm to help people relate it to their own cultural setting:

Verses 1-2:

1. In these verses, the psalmist is questioning God's presence and seemingly inactive response to the wicked. Have you ever felt like God is distant or unconcerned when faced with injustice? How does this resonate with your own experiences and cultural understanding?

2. How do you interpret the psalmist's description of the wicked as "boasting of the desires of their heart"? In your cultural context, how do people express their desires and ambitions, and to what extent can they lead to injustice or oppression?

Verses 3-4:

1. The psalmist laments the arrogance and prosperity of the wicked, while the weak and oppressed suffer. Can you think of any examples of this in your own cultural setting? How does it make you feel when you witness such injustices?

2. In what ways does the psalmist express his understanding of God's character and justice in these verses? How does this align or differ from your cultural beliefs about God and justice?

Verses 5-11:

1. The psalmist describes the wicked person's sinful actions and schemes. How do these descriptions relate to experiences of corruption, oppression, or violence in your own cultural context?

2. While the wicked appear to be in control, the psalmist expresses confidence in God's justice. How can this perspective bring comfort and hope to those who experience injustice in your own cultural context?

Verses 12-15:

1. The psalmist calls on God to rise up and bring justice to the oppressed. How do you personally relate to this call for God's justice and deliverance in your own cultural setting?

2. The psalmist expresses the hope that God will restore justice and defend the fatherless and the oppressed. What are some practical ways in which we can advocate for justice and support those who are oppressed in our own cultural context?

Verses 16-18:

1. The psalmist acknowledges God's sovereignty and reign over all generations. How does this understanding of God's sovereignty and eternal nature impact your own faith and hope for justice in your cultural context?

2. The psalm concludes with a prayer for God to "break the arm of the wicked." How can we, as followers of God, pray for justice and deliverance for those who are oppressed in our own cultural setting?
