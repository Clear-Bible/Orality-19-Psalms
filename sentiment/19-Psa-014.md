This XML schema gives translation teams a structured guide to assess each verse's sentiment, associated emotions, and the intensity of those emotions. Contextual notes are especially important, as they not only provide background for the sentiments and emotions but also help translators consider cultural and situational aspects that might affect the translation in their language.
