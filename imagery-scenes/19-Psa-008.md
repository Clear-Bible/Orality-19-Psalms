### Outline and Imagery in Psalm 8

1. **Praise for Divine Majesty** (vv. 1-2)
   - **Major Imagery**: Heavens, Stars, and Babes
   - The majesty of God is exalted through imagery of the heavens and stars, highlighting divine grandeur. The praise of infants underscores purity and innocence in acknowledging divine glory, pointing towards an appreciation for the power of genuine, unadulterated adoration.

2. **Human Frailty and Divine Favor** (vv. 3-5)
   - **Major Imagery**: Heavens, Stars, and Mankind
   - Pondering the stars and the heavens leads to contemplation of human insignificance. Yet, the Psalmist marvels at human beings being made a little lower than God (or the angels), encapsulating a juxtaposition of human frailty and divine favor. 

3. **Dominion of Humanity** (vv. 6-8)
   - **Major Imagery**: Creatures and Creation
   - Humanity's dominion over creation, represented through imagery of animals and elements of the earth, underscores the honor and responsibility bestowed upon people by God, amplifying the marvel of divine trust in humanity despite their perceived insignificance.

4. **Reiteration of Divine Majesty** (v. 9)
   - **Major Imagery**: Lord’s Name
   - Closing as it began, the Psalmist reiterates the unparalleled majesty of the Lord, encasing the Psalm in a frame of reverence and awe towards the Creator, which contrasts yet complements the thematic exploration of human standing and responsibility within creation.

Psalm 8 traverses a spiritual and existential contemplation of humanity's place within the cosmos, intertwining images of celestial majesty with the terrestrial responsibility of human beings. It invites reflection on the paradox of the seemingly inconsequential human existence amid vast creation, against the bestowed divine favor and significant earthly dominion. This interplay between divine majesty and human dignity touches upon profound emotional and existential themes, aligning with Nussbaum’s perspectives on emotion as evaluative judgments concerning things we deem of great significance. The Psalm, thereby, bridges awe, reflection, responsibility, and reverence in its emotional and thematic tapestry.
