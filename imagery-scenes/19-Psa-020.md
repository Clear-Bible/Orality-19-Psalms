# Imagery Outline of Psalm 20

## Scene 1: A Prayer for Victory

> May the Lord answer you when you are in distress; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion. - Psalm 20:1-2 (NIV)

<!--- I'm not sure the suggested scene/imagery captures the sense of "when you are in distress," which I don't read as the same as "a person in distress." There is a sense of calling for aid WHEN you are in distress, not that you are in distress now. I think that colors what follows as not being immediate need/request but to be satisfied at some future moment. That may be one of those things that human editors need to apply but make a note to watch for senses of time. I don't think AIs have a well-developed sense of time. All is present to them. --->
