1. **Feeling the Psalm:**
   - How does reading about the person who finds joy in God make you feel? Can you think of a story or a person in your community who reminds you of this part of the Psalm?

2. **Picture This:**
   - Psalm 1 mentions a tree planted by water. What kind of tree or place in your town or village makes you think of a happy and flourishing life?
   - The Psalm also talks about chaff being blown away. What does this picture make you think of in real life? Can you think of an example from your community where something worthless or harmful was swept away?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The person described in the Psalm loves God's teachings and thinks about them all the time. Is there something you love doing so much that you can't stop thinking about it? How does it make you feel when you engage in that activity?
   - How can you be like the tree mentioned in the Psalm in your own life? How can you avoid being like the useless chaff?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - The Psalm talks about people who choose to do what is right and those who choose to do what is wrong. Can you think of examples in your life or community where people have made these kinds of choices?
   - How does making the right choice positively impact your family and community? Have you witnessed any examples of this in your own life?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Are there particular plants or locations in your area that are universally recognized to symbolize strength or goodness? What about places or things that are considered negative or weak? How are these symbols perceived by people in your community?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do good or bad choices made by individuals affect your friends and family? Can you share a story or an example of how someone's choices impacted your community?
   - What positive things happen in your community when people make the right choices? And conversely, what negative consequences do you observe when people make the wrong choices?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm ends by suggesting that God watches over good people. How does it make you feel to know that God pays attention to your life? Can you think of any experiences where you felt God's presence or care?
   - In what ways do you try to live in a righteous and good manner so that God watches over you? Can you share any practices or actions you take to honour God in your daily life?
