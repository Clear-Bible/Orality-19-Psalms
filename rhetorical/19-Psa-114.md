Note: In ancient Hebrew wisdom literature, such as the Psalms, there is often a pattern of acknowledging God's deliverance and power, followed by a call to worship and praise. This outline follows that pattern, highlighting the writer's recognition of God's deliverance from Egypt, His miracle in providing for His people, and the concluding exclamation of His majesty and power. The repetition of the call to praise at the beginning and end of the psalm serves as a framing device, emphasizing the central theme of acknowledging and praising God.
