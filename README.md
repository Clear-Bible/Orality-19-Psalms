This repository contains a variety of analyses of Scripture and sets of questions, initially generated using GPT.  This is experimental, and should not be considered trustworthy without human editing and checking.  We plan to do that, working iwth partners.  Currently, this repository should be seen as a proof of concept.

The following analyses have been done:

- [emotions](./emotions) - emotional flow and analysis according to Martha Nussbaum's model of emotion
- [imagery](./imagery-scenes) - outlines based on scenes and salient imagery
- [rhetoric](./rhetorical) - outlines based on rhetorical flow
- [internalization](./questions/internalization/) - questions aimed at guided internalization by considering issues from the above analyses in their own cultural setting
- [engagement](./questions/internalization/) - questions aimed at scripture engagement in the community where translation is being done

# Intended Audience

These analyses are a proof of concept to explore generating analyses that could be helpful for audiences like these:

1. A translation consultant who is working with an oral translation project
2. A resource developer creating resources for oral translators
3. Scripture engagement teams creating materials for local communities
4. Local preachers

To be truly useful, these analyses should be checked, edited, and tested by humans.
