Psalm 52 does not have distinct scenes like a play or a movie; it is a religious poem or song attributed to King David. However, I can provide you with the verse references and describe the salient imagery in each section of the Psalm:

1. Verses 1-4:
Scene: David addressing the wicked and deceitful person.
Imagery: The wicked person is depicted as boasting about their evil deeds, speaking deceit, and harming others. Their tongue is likened to a sharp razor, and they are portrayed as loving evil more than good.

2. Verses 5-7:
Scene: David emphasizing the righteous judgment of God.
Imagery: David describes God's judgment upon the wicked person as God bringing them down for their misdeeds. The image of God uprooting or tearing down the wicked, as well as God's laughter at their downfall, portrays divine justice.

3. Verses 8-9:
Scene: David contrasting the wicked person with himself and the righteous.
Imagery: David presents himself as being like an olive tree planted in God's house, symbolizing stability and prosperity. The contrast is drawn between the wicked person being uprooted and David's trust in God's steadfast love and faithfulness.

4. Verse 10:
Scene: David expressing hope and gratitude in God's presence.
Imagery: David affirms his reliance on God's presence, praising Him and declaring his trust in God's name.

The eudaimonic force (wellbeing and fulfillment) experienced through these images may include a sense of justice, assurance in divine protection, trust in God's love and faithfulness, and gratitude for God's presence.
