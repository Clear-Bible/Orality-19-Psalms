1. **Desperation and Reliance (vv. 1-3)**
   - **Despair and Hope**: The psalmist reveals a profound desperation, marked by the emotional agony of a prolonged wait for divine intervention. This intertwines with a clinging hope and trust that God, as the recipient of morning prayers, will respond.
   
2. **Acknowledgment and Assurance (vv. 4-7)**
   - **Fear and Confidence**: A conscious acknowledgment of God’s hatred towards evil elicits a fear of divine wrath against the wicked. Concurrently, a palpable confidence emanates from the assurance of God’s steadfast love towards the worshiper, solidifying an emotionally secure foundation amidst the external moral chaos.
   
3. **Humility and Trustful Exuberance (vv. 8-12)**
   - **Humility and Joy**: The psalmist exhibits humility in seeking divine guidance and, subsequently, a trust-filled joy in God’s protective and blessing nature. There’s an emotional shift from self-deprecation in the plea to an uplifting assurance, anticipating divine favor and protection over the righteous.

### In-depth Nussbaum-Inspired Analysis:

1. **Value Judgment and Ethical Implication (vv. 1-3)**
   - The emotional cry of the psalmist reflects a robust value judgment, implying an understanding of God as a source of hope and relief amidst despair. The ethics of dependency are evident, navigating through personal vulnerability and a tenacious grasp of divine reliability.
   
2. **Ethical Consistency and Emotional Security (vv. 4-7)**
   - Through the delineation of God’s moral preferences, the psalmist not only affirms the divine ethical stance but also anchors emotional security in God’s consistent moral nature. The divine aversion to wickedness and love for the righteous constructs an emotionally and ethically stable environment for the worshiper.

3. **Vulnerability and Eudaimonic Prosperity (vv. 8-12)**
   - The humility exhibited through the requests for guidance signals an emotional and ethical vulnerability, acknowledging human limitation and divine supremacy. The subsequent joy and expectation of blessings not only encapsulate eudaimonic emotions that underscore flourishing but also weave a narrative where ethical submission to the divine culminates in joyous assurance and anticipated prosperity.

Nussbaum’s framework allows us to explore how the emotions expressed in Psalm 5 don’t just reveal the psalmist's inner states but significantly inform about his relational dynamics with God, ethical understandings, and perspectives on divine-human interactions, crafting a rich tapestry that intertwines emotional experiences with theological, ethical, and existential reflections.
