Psalm 20 does not have distinct scenes like a play or a movie. It is a poem consisting of verses, which collectively convey a message or a theme. However, I can provide you with a breakdown of the verses and discuss the imagery and overall impact of each segment. 

Verse 1:
May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; 
may the name of the God of Jacob protect you!

In this verse, the imagery reflects a plea for protection and assistance from God during times of trouble or distress. It creates the image of God as a shield, guarding and shielding the individual from harm. The eudaimonic force stems from the sense of reliance on a higher power for help amidst difficulties.

Verses 2-3:
May he send you help from the sanctuary 
and give you support from Zion! 
May he remember all your offerings
and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices!

Here, the imagery emphasizes the connection between the individual and the divine. The mention of the sanctuary and Zion suggests a sacred space where divine aid is sought. The eudaimonic force lies in the belief that one's faith and acts of devotion are acknowledged by God, leading to divine assistance and support.

Verses 4-5:
May he grant you your heart's desire 
and fulfill all your plans! 
May we shout for joy over your salvation, 
and in the name of our God set up our banners!

These verses evoke imagery of celebration and victory. The granting of one's desires and fulfillment of plans creates an image of success and accomplishment. The mention of shouting for joy and setting up banners represents communal rejoicing and a sense of collective triumph. The eudaimonic force here derives from the fulfillment of personal aspirations and the shared joy of a community.

Verse 6:
May the LORD fulfill all your petitions!

In this verse, the imagery is simple yet powerful. It reiterates the desire for the fulfillment of all the individual's prayers and requests. The eudaimonic force lies in the hope that all needs and desires are met by a benevolent and responsive God.

Verses 7-8:
Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed;
he will answer him from his holy heaven
with the saving might of his right hand.
Some trust in chariots and some in horses,
but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.

These verses employ imagery of salvation and divine intervention. The concept of being anointed by the Lord evokes the image of being chosen and protected by a higher power. The contrasting image of trusting in chariots and horses versus trusting in God highlights the theme of reliance on divine assistance rather than earthly strength. The eudaimonic force lies in the assurance of deliverance and the recognition that true security comes from faith in God rather than mere material possessions.

Verses 9-1:
They collapse and fall, 
but we rise and stand upright. 
O LORD, save the king!
May he answer us when we call.

In the final verses, the imagery of falling and rising creates a vivid contrast. Collapse and failure are depicted for those who do not trust in God, while rising and standing upright represent resilience and success for the faithful. The plea for the salvation of the king reinforces the overarching theme of divine intervention. The eudaimonic force here lies in the belief that devotion to God leads to a steadfast and victorious existence, even in the face of adversity.
