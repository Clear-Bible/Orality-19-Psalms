Certainly, let us analyze Psalm 86 for sentiment, which will be helpful as you prepare for translation into another language. Below is an example for the first verse. You would then follow this format for the subsequent verses.

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="86">
        <verse number="1">
            <text>Hear me, LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Supplication</emotion>
            <intensity>Moderate</intensity>
            <context>The psalmist is presenting themselves as destitute and in need, invoking empathy and a plea for help.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat for each verse -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

In each verse, you will look for key indicators such as adjectives, nouns, and verbs that have connotative meaning, which contribute to the overall sentiment. Polarity refers to whether the verse expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Emotion tries to capture the primary feeling expressed by the psalmist, such as joy, fear, trust, etc. Intensity measures the strength of the sentiment or emotion on a scale that could be low, moderate, or high. Contextual notes may include literary, historical, or cultural information that sheds light on the sentiment or emotion of the verse.
