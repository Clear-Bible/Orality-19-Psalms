Psalm 39 can be divided into three distinct scenes, each presenting an imagery that contributes to the overall message of the psalm.

Scene 1 (Verses 1-6):
In the first scene of Psalm 39, the psalmist contemplates the fleeting nature of human life. The verses express a theme of silence and restraint as the psalmist is careful with his words. The imagery used here highlights the brevity of life and the transient nature of human existence. The psalmist uses metaphors like a handbreadth, a mere breath, and a shadow to describe the ephemeral nature of life. These vivid images convey a sense of insignificance and fragility, urging the audience to reflect on the vanity of worldly pursuits.

Scene 2 (Verses 7-11):
Moving into the second scene, the imagery shifts to that of a person in anguish or agony. The psalmist becomes more vocal in expressing their distress and the weight of their suffering. The verses describe the psalmist's experience of physical and emotional pain, which is likened to an oppressive burden. The imagery of being crushed under the weight of suffering evokes a visceral response, allowing the audience to empathize with the psalmist's anguish. These images emphasize the torment that can accompany the human condition.

Scene 3 (Verses 12-13):
In the final scene, the psalmist shifts their focus towards God, seeking deliverance and refuge. Here, the imagery takes a more hopeful and trusting tone. The psalmist acknowledges their own transience and dependence on God's intervention. The imagery used in this scene portrays the psalmist as a pilgrim or a stranger, no longer dwelling on the brevity of life but looking towards God for guidance. The psalmist's plea for God's favor is depicted as a release from their suffering and a sense of renewal.

Overall, Psalm 39 moves from contemplating the fleeting nature of life to expressing anguish and finally finding hope and reliance on God. The vivid imagery employed throughout the scenes serves to evoke a deep emotional response from the readers, urging them to reflect on the transience of life, the weight of suffering, and the importance of trusting in a higher power.
