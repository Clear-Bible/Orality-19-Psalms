2: הוֹלֵ֣ךְ תָּ֭מִים וּפֹעֵ֥ל צֶ֑דֶק וְדֹבֵ֥ר אֱ֝מֶ֗ת בִּלְבָבֽוֹ׃
3: לֹֽא־ רָגַ֨ל ׀ עַל־ לְשֹׁנ֗וֹ לֹא־ עָשָׂ֣ה לְרֵעֵ֣הוּ רָעָ֑ה וְ֝חֶרְפָּ֗ה לֹא־ נָשָׂ֥א עַל־ קְרֹֽבוֹ׃
4: נִבְזֶ֤ה ׀ בְּֽעֵ֘ינָ֤יו נִמְאָ֗ס וְאֶת־ יִרְאֵ֣י יְהוָ֣ה יְכַבֵּ֑ד נִשְׁבַּ֥ע לְ֝הָרַ֗ע וְלֹ֣א יָמִֽר׃
5: כַּסְפּ֤וֹ ׀ לֹא־ נָתַ֣ן בְּנֶשֶׁךְ֮ וְשֹׁ֥חַד עַל־ נָקִ֗י לֹ֥א לָ֫קָ֥ח עֹֽשֵׂה־ אֵ֑לֶּה לֹ֖א יִמּ֣וֹט לְעוֹלָֽם׃
