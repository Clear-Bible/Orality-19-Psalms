1. **Feeling the Psalm:**
   - As you read about the person who is blessed, how does it make you feel? Can you think of a story from your culture that reminds you of this part of the Psalm?

2. **Picture This:**
   - Psalm 87 talks about a tree by the water. Can you think of a tree or a place in your hometown that symbolizes a happy and healthy life?
   - The Psalm also mentions chaff blown away by the wind. What does this image make you think of in real life?

3. **Your Daily Life:**
   - The happy person in the Psalm loves and thinks about God's teachings all the time. What is something you love to do so much that you constantly think about it?
   - How can you be like the tree in your own life? How can you avoid being like the chaff?

4. **Right and Wrong:**
   - Just like in Psalm 87, there are people who make good choices and people who make bad choices in our lives. Can you think of examples of these kinds of choices in your own life or community?
   - How does making good choices benefit people in your family or neighborhood? Have you seen any examples of this?

5. **Symbols in Your World:**
   - Do you have any plants or places in your area that everyone recognizes as symbols of strength or goodness? What about places or things that are seen as bad or weak?

6. **Decisions and Community:**
   - How do good or bad choices made by your friends and family affect your community? Can you share a story about that?
   - What positive things happen in your community when people make the right choices? And what happens when they don't?

7. **Talking to God:**
   - The Psalm ends by saying that God watches over good people. How does it make you feel knowing that God pays attention to your life?
   - In what ways do you try to live in a way that pleases God so that He watches over you?

These questions are meant to help you deeply connect with Psalm 87 and apply its teachings to your own life and culture. They encourage you to think about living well and making wise choices based on the messages in the Psalm.
