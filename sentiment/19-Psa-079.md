Psalm 79 is a communal lament, reflecting on the distress the community feels over the destruction of Jerusalem and the defilement of the Temple by foreign nations. As we consider the sentiment analysis for each verse in Psalm 79, it's important to note that sentiment can often be complex, composed of multiple layers and shades of emotion. Below, I outline a sentiment analysis template for Psalm 79 that can be adapted to each verse as required:

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="79"> <!-- Example for Psalm 79 -->
        <verse number="1">
            <text>O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Anguish/Sorrow</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>The verse depicts the destruction of sacred places in Jerusalem, symbolizing deep communal trauma.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="2">
            <text>They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the sky, the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Mourning</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>This verse continues to describe the horrors faced by the community. It suggests profound disrespect for the dead, which compounds the community's suffering.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Repeat this structure for each verse, identifying the sentiment and context. -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

For your translation work, you will need to go through Psalm 79 verse by verse, conducting a sentiment analysis for each. Here are some tips for doing so:

1. Read the verse carefully and understand its literal meaning.
2. Identify the emotional tone: is it positive, negative, or neutral?
3. Determine the emotion: what specific feeling does it convey? (e.g., joy, anger, sorrow, hope, etc.)
4. Assess the intensity: how strong is the sentiment expressed? (low, moderate, high)
5. Consider the context: relate the verse to its historical and cultural background, and its place within the psalm as a whole.

This exercise will not only aid in the selection of appropriate words and expressions in the target language but also in conveying the right connotations and emotional undercurrents inherent to the text.
