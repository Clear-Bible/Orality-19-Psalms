As a translation consultant preparing resources for translation teams, my goal is to facilitate an accurate and culturally resonant translation of the Bible into the target language. The teams will benefit from a combination of textual analysis and ongoing engagement with the linguistic, cultural, and theological contexts of their audience. Considering Psalm 25 as an example, I will provide a template for sentiment analysis for a range of verses, which teams can then apply to the entire Psalm as they work on their translation.

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="25">
        <verse number="1">
            <text>To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul.</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Trust</emotion>
            <intensity>Moderate</intensity>
            <context>To accurately translate the emotional content, consider how the concept of lifting up one's soul is understood in the target culture and find an equivalent expression of trust and devotion to God.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="2">
            <text>O my God, in you I trust, let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies triumph over me.</text>
            <polarity>Positive</polarity>
            <emotion>Trust mixed with Fear</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>The translator must navigate the dual sentiment of trust in God's protection and fear of shame or defeat, ensuring that these nuanced emotions are conveyed in the target language.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="3">
            <text>No one who hopes in you will ever be put to shame, but shame will come on those who are treacherous without cause.</text>
            <polarity>Positive to Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Hope to Indignation</emotion>
            <intensity>Moderate to High</intensity>
            <context>This verse contains a shift from the hope of the righteous to the condemnation of the treacherous. Translation should capture the contrast between the two groups and the moral implications.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- Additional verses would continue the analysis -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

This template demonstrates how to dissect each verse for its emotional and moral sentiments, intensity, and overall theological message. The "context" section is meant to assist the translation team by offering insights into potential interpretative challenges and cultural equivalences. The full Psalm should be analyzed verse by verse in a similar fashion to ensure a comprehensive understanding and translation of its content.

Please keep in mind the great diversity in the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of the translation teams. Providing thorough explanations and offering multiple examples or cultural correlates can be invaluable in ensuring that the translation is both accurate and accessible.
