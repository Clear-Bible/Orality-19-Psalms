- **Confusion and Inner Conflict (vv. 3-5)**: The emotional complexity might be seen, through Nussbaum’s lens, as intrinsic to the human condition, exploring how faith and personal suffering can coexist in a challenging emotional and existential terrain.

- **Anticipatory Hope and Resolve (vv. 22-31)**: Viewing this through Nussbaum’s framework, one can perceive how the emotional transformation from despair to hope, and the subsequent resolve to praise, might signify an anticipatory eudaimonia, where the expectation of deliverance and the ensuing proclamation of it embody a crucial part of human flourishing.
