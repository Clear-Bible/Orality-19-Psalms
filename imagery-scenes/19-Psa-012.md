Psalm 12 is a relatively short psalm consisting of eight verses. While it doesn't contain distinct scenes in the traditional sense, we can identify key elements and phrases that can be considered as different "scenes" within the psalm. Here they are:

1. Scene of Lament (Verses 1-2):
   "Help, Lord, for no one is faithful anymore;
    those who are loyal have vanished from the human race.
    Everyone lies to their neighbor;
    they flatter with their lips but harbor deception in their hearts."

   Salient Imagery: The psalmist laments the lack of faithfulness and honesty among people. The disappearance of the faithful is emphasized, and the contrast between outward flattery and internal deception is depicted.

   Eudaimonic Force: This scene evokes a sense of despair and a longing for trustworthy individuals, highlighting the importance of integrity and truthfulness in fostering a harmonious society.

2. Scene of Divine Assurance (Verses 5-6):
   "Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan,
    I will now arise,” says the Lord.
    “I will protect them from those who malign them."
  
   Salient Imagery: Here, God is depicted as hearing the cries of the oppressed and promises to protect them from their oppressors. The imagery evokes a divine intervention in favor of the vulnerable and voiceless.

   Eudaimonic Force: This scene offers hope and comfort to those who suffer injustice, reinforcing the belief in God's justice and care for the marginalized. It provides reassurance that their groans will not go unheard.

3. Scene of Divine Preservation (Verses 7-8):
   "You, Lord, will keep the needy safe
    and will protect us forever from the wicked,
    who freely strut about
    when what is vile is honored by the human race."

   Salient Imagery: Here, the psalmist acknowledges God as the ultimate protector of the needy and the righteous. The wicked are depicted as freely strutting about, while society honors things considered vile or immoral.

   Eudaimonic Force: This scene offers confidence in God's unfaltering protection, emphasizing the contrast between the wicked and the divine preservation of the righteous. It highlights the importance of relying on God's shelter for those facing adversity.

While these identified "scenes" may not follow a standard narrative structure, they represent distinct thematic shifts or emphases within Psalm 12, conveying various aspects of human nature, divine intervention, and the desired state of society.
