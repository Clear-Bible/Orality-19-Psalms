Sentiment analysis is a modern analytical tool not traditionally found within the framework of biblical translation. However, to aid your translation process, let's explore a hypothetical sentiment analysis of Psalm 94, focusing on its key emotions and contexts. This Psalm is a plea for God's vengeance and justice against the wicked, and it combines a call for retribution with a declaration of trust in Godâ€™s governance.

Here is an example of how sentiment analysis might look like for the beginning of Psalm 94:

```xml
<sentimentAnalysis>
    <psalm number="94">
        <verse number="1">
            <text>O Lord, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Anguish/Anticipation</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>The Psalmist is calling on God's role as an avenger against the wicked.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="2">
            <text>Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve.</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Anger/Demand</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>There is a demand for divine justice on the proud and wicked.</context>
        </verse>
        <verse number="3">
            <text>How long, O Lord, will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant?</text>
            <polarity>Negative</polarity>
            <emotion>Impatience/Frustration</emotion>
            <intensity>High</intensity>
            <context>Expression of frustration at the apparent delay in God's justice.</context>
        </verse>
        <!-- The analysis would continue for each verse -->
    </psalm>
</sentimentAnalysis>
```

For each verse, you would follow this pattern and fill in the fields for polarity, emotion, intensity, and context after careful study of the text and its theological implications. The sentiment generally would oscillate between the negative feelings associated with the injustice of the wicked and positive expressions of trust in God's righteous judgment. Remember that Psalm 94, like many other psalms, contains complex emotions and theological themes that can be difficult to fully capture in a sentiment analysis. Thus, such a tool should be used thoughtfully, as one of many resources when translating scripture.
