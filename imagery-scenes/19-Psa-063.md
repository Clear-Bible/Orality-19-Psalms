7: אִם־ זְכַרְתִּ֥יךָ עַל־ יְצוּעָ֑י בְּ֝אַשְׁמֻר֗וֹת אֶהְגֶּה־ בָּֽךְ׃
8: כִּֽי־ הָיִ֣יתָ עֶזְרָ֣תָה לִּ֑י וּבְצֵ֖ל כְּנָפֶ֣יךָ אֲרַנֵּֽן׃
9: דָּבְקָ֣ה נַפְשִׁ֣י אַחֲרֶ֑יךָ בִּ֝֗י תָּמְכָ֥ה יְמִינֶֽךָ׃
10: וְהֵ֗מָּה לְ֭שׁוֹאָה יְבַקְשׁ֣וּ נַפְשִׁ֑י יָ֝בֹ֗אוּ בְּֽתַחְתִּיּ֥וֹת הָאָֽרֶץ׃
11: יַגִּירֻ֥הוּ עַל־ יְדֵי־ חָ֑רֶב מְנָ֖ת שֻׁעָלִ֣ים יִהְיֽוּ׃
12: וְהַמֶּלֶךְ֮ יִשְׂמַ֪ח בֵּאלֹ֫הִ֥ים יִ֭תְהַלֵּל כָּל־ הַנִּשְׁבָּ֣ע בּ֑וֹ כִּ֥י יִ֝סָּכֵ֗ר פִּ֣י דֽוֹבְרֵי־ שָֽׁקֶר׃
