This repository contains a variety of analyses of Scripture and sets of questions, initially generated using GPT:

- [emotions](./emotions) - emotional flow and analysis according to Martha Nussbaum's model of emotion
- [imagery](./imagery-scenes) - outlines based on scenes and salient imagery
- [rhetoric](./rhetoric) - outlines based on rhetorical flow
- [internalization](./questions/internalization/) - questions aimed at guided internalization by considering issues from the above analyses in their own cultural setting
- [engagement](./questions/internalization/) - questions aimed at scripture engagement in the community where translation is being done

# Intended Audience

These analyses are designed for audiences such as:

1. A translation consultant who is working with an oral translation project
2. A resource developer creating resources for oral translators
3. Scripture engagement teams creating materials for local communities
4. Local preachers

# Status

These analyses are generated using NLP, and should not be considered trustworthy without human checking and editing.  We plan to do that, working with partners.

Currently, they should be treated as a proof of concept.

# Influences

The analysis in this repository is influenced by [Psalms that Sing](https://www.psalmsthatsing.org/), [Psalms: Layer by Layer](https://psalms.cdbr.org/w/Welcome), and Josh Frost's [Oral Bible Translation Research and Resources](https://publish.obsidian.md/obt-research-and-resources/).
