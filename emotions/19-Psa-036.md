# Emotional Flow and Analysis in Light of Nussbaum's Views

1. **The Deceit of Wickedness (vv. 1-4)**
    - **Concern and Disdain**: The psalm starts with an introspective mood, where the psalmist expresses concern over the self-deception of the wicked. This deception, characterized by sinful silence and planning of wrongdoings, stirs a feeling of disdain, emphasizing the moral disconnect the wicked experience by not fearing God.
    
2. **God’s Steadfast Love and Righteousness (vv. 5-9)**
    - **Wonder and Security**: Moving away from the sullen thoughts on wickedness, the psalmist is filled with wonder and admiration for God’s unfathomable love and faithfulness. These emotions are rich and profound, as they contemplate the comforting assurance found under God's protective wings and the abundant satisfaction from the "river of delights." It's an emotional high point that contrasts sharply with the feelings towards human depravity.
    
3. **Plea for Love, Righteousness, and Justice (vv. 10-12)**
    - **Hope and Righteous Longing**: In the concluding section, there’s a hopeful longing within the psalmist’s plea. They seek the extension of God’s mercy and righteousness to those living in loyalty with Him. Simultaneously, there's an anticipatory satisfaction, a form of schadenfreude, regarding the future downfall of the wicked. This complex emotional closure intertwines assurance in divine justice with personal vindication and safety.

In Psalm 36, emotions fluctuate from deep concern and disdain for wickedness to awe-inspired security in God’s love, and finally to a hopeful longing for righteousness and divine justice. These aren't fleeting feelings but are deeply connected to the individuals' values and their perceptions of human nature and divine character, serving as moral navigators. Nussbaum's perspective would appreciate these emotional phases as critical insights into the human condition, reflecting our vulnerabilities, aspirations, and the intrinsic need for justice and divine refuge.
