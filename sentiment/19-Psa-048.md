<!-- Instructions to the user:
- Replace the square brackets and content within with the actual verse number and text.
- Analyze the sentiment of each verse according to the polarity (positive, negative, neutral), the emotion it conveys, the intensity of that emotion (low, moderate, high), and any crucial contextual notes that might affect the sentiment.
- Repeat the structure for each verse in the psalm, filling in the template with the appropriate information. --> 

<!-- Note to the user:
- Consider cultural implications when translating emotions, as the perception of emotions can vary greatly between different cultures.
- When determining intensity, it is important to consider both the linguistic and situational context of the verse.
- Contextual notes should also include any historical or literary elements that are important for understanding the sentiment of the verse. -->
