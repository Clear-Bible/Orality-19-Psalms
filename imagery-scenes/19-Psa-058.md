Psalm 58 does not have distinct scenes like a play or a novel. However, it contains vivid descriptions and strong imagery throughout. Here are a few notable verses and the imagery they convey:

1. Verse 3: "The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies." This verse paints a striking image of wickedness as something ingrained in individuals from the very beginning. It suggests that deceitfulness is ingrained in their nature.

2. Verse 4: "Their venom is like the venom of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stops its ear." Here, a serpent is used as a metaphor for the wicked, emphasizing their poisonous and unhearing nature. This imagery conveys the dangerous and unresponsive qualities of these individuals.

3. Verse 6: "O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD!" This verse uses the imagery of powerful animals to portray the strength and aggression of the wicked. It calls upon God to dismantle their harmful influence.

4. Verse 7: "Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted." This verse employs the imagery of fleeting water and blunted arrows to symbolize the ultimate ineffectiveness and transience of the wicked. Their actions will bear no lasting impact.

5. Verse 10: "The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked." In this verse, the blood of the wicked is used as a metaphorical symbol of their downfall and defeat. The image of bathing feet in their blood implies that justice has been served and that righteousness has come out victorious.

Throughout Psalm 58, various vivid images are used to convey the wickedness of the individuals being described and to express the contrasting hope for justice and righteous retribution.
