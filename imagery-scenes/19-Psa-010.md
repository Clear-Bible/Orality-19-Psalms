### Outline and Imagery in Psalm 10

1. **Questioning God's Absence** (vv. 1)
   - **Major Imagery**: Distance and Times of Trouble
   - The perception of God being far in times of trouble, embodying a visceral feeling of divine absence and silent heavens during periods of distress, manifesting a stark emotional response that encapsulates abandonment and desperation.

2. **Wickedness Prevails** (vv. 2-11)
   - **Major Imagery**: Pursuit, Sneering, Lurking, and Desolation
   - A detailed depiction of the wicked who prey upon the vulnerable, providing a vivid picture of injustice, oppression, arrogance, and atheistic confidence, elicits emotions ranging from anger and fear to sorrow for the oppressed.

3. **God, the Inactive Observer?** (vv. 12-13)
   - **Major Imagery**: Awakening and Forgetting
   - A plea for God to awaken and not forget the humble and oppressed employs emotive elements of desperation, marginalization, and a longing for divine intervention, questioning God’s memory and attentiveness toward human suffering.

4. **Affirmation of God’s Justice** (vv. 14-15)
   - **Major Imagery**: Fatherless, Heart, and Arm
   - The transition from despair to a reassurance that God does, indeed, see and act, pivoting towards imagery that personifies God as a parental, avenging figure, sparking feelings of vindication and cautious optimism among the faithful.

5. **Prayer for Divine Intervention** (vv. 16-18)
   - **Major Imagery**: Nations, Orphan, and Oppressed
   - The psalmist leads into a declarative prayer, where nations perish but God endures forever, entwining themes of divine eternity and attentive justice, concluding on a juxtaposition that uplifts the emotional trajectory from despair towards hope and trust.

In Psalm 10, the emotion travels through a path of questioning despair, viscerally observing wickedness, fervently pleading for divine attention, affirming God’s attentive justice, and ultimately laying hopes in divine intervention. These emotional progressions, while confronting difficult themes of apparent divine absence and prevailing injustice, draw parallel with Martha Nussbaum's concepts that emotions give insights into our values and our perceptions of our surroundings and circumstances. From the depths of perceived divine distance and desperate pleas to the cautious optimism of vindication, the psalmist intertwines the complex emotional and moral textures of humanity’s relational experience with God.
