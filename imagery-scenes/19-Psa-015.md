Psalm 15 does not have distinct scene divisions. It consists of 5 verses and describes the qualities of a person who is considered righteous and worthy of dwelling in God's presence. Hence, I will provide a brief description and imagery for each verse:

Verse 1:
"The one who walks blamelessly, does what is right, and speaks truth in their heart."

Salient Imagery: The image here is of an individual who lives a life of integrity. They walk blamelessly, meaning they exhibit moral uprightness in their actions, and they consistently do what is right. Their speech is characterized by truthfulness and honesty. This image reflects a person's commitment to righteousness and their ability to align their words and actions accordingly.

Verse 2:
"Who does not slander with their tongue, and does no evil to their neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against their friends."

Salient Imagery: This verse portrays someone who refrains from using their words to harm others. They do not engage in gossip or spreading false rumors (slander). Additionally, they actively avoid causing harm to their neighbors, expressing a sense of kindness and compassion. Their choice to not involve themselves in negative talk or actions reflects their commitment to maintaining positive relationships and protecting the welfare of others.

Verse 3:
"In whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord; who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind."

Salient Imagery: This verse depicts an individual who holds high moral standards. They have a discerning eye to differentiate between those who engage in wickedness and those who revere and respect the Lord. They show honor and respect towards God-fearing individuals. Furthermore, they are known for their reliability in keeping their promises, even when fulfilling them brings personal difficulty or hardship. This image portrays someone who possesses a steadfast commitment to truth, consistency, and loyalty.

Verse 4:
"Who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent."

Salient Imagery: The image in this verse is of someone who demonstrates generosity and fairness. They lend money to the poor without expecting anything in return, refusing to exploit someone's vulnerable situation. Furthermore, they refuse to accept bribes that may lead to unjust consequences for the innocent. This image highlights their compassion towards the needy and their commitment to upholding justice and equity.

Verse 5:
"Whoever does these things shall never be moved."

Salient Imagery: The closing image of Psalm 15 suggests that the person who embodies the characteristics mentioned previously will not be shaken or moved from a state of righteousness or God's favor. This imagery portrays stability, security, and an enduring state of being grounded in God's presence.

Overall, the salient imagery in Psalm 15 revolves around living a life of moral uprightness, integrity, compassion, and justice. It presents a depiction of an individual who embodies these qualities and is anchored in their connection with God, promising stability and steadfastness.
